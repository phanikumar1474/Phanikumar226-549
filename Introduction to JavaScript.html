Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic websites.

Features of JavaScript
Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting, which means it runs in the user's web browser.
Interactivity: JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your web pages by responding to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.
Dynamic Content: With JavaScript, you can manipulate HTML elements and dynamically update the content of your web pages without reloading them.
Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Rich Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify web development and allow you to build complex applications.
Getting Started with JavaScript
To start using JavaScript in your web projects, you can include it directly within your HTML documents using the <script> tag:


        <script>
            // JavaScript code goes here
        </script>
    
You can also link external JavaScript files using the <script> tag's src attribute:


        <script src="script.js"></script>
    
JavaScript code written within <script> tags or external files can be placed in the <head> or <body> sections of your HTML document.
