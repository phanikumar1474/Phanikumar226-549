<h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
<l1><strong>Client-Side Scripting:</strong> JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting, which means it runs in the user's web browser.</l1>
<l2><h2>Interactivity:</h2> JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to your web pages by responding to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.</l2>
<l3><h2>Dynamic Content:</h2> With JavaScript, you can manipulate HTML elements and dynamically update the content of your web pages without reloading them.</l3>
<l4><h2>Browser Compatibility:</h2> JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</l4>
<l5><h2>Rich Ecosystem:</h2> JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify web development and allow you to build complex applications.</l5>
<h2>Getting Started with JavaScript</h2>
To start using JavaScript in your web projects, you can include it directly within your HTML documents using the <script> tag:

        <script>
            // JavaScript code goes here
        </script>
    
You can also link external JavaScript files using the <script> tag's src attribute:


        <script src="script.js"></script>
    
JavaScript code written within <script> tags or external files can be placed in the <head> or <body> sections of your HTML document.
